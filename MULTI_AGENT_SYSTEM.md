# ü§ñ Multi-Agent Development System

**Established**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: ‚úÖ Live and Operational
**Repository**: threads-nextjs with threads-ml submodule

---

## Overview

This project now uses a **multi-agent development system** where specialized agents coordinate work through well-defined communication protocols and context files.

### Why This System?

- **Specialization**: Each agent has deep expertise in their domain
- **Clear Responsibility**: No overlap, no confusion about who owns what
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents (Frontend Architect, DevOps, etc.)
- **Coordination**: Central task board ensures alignment
- **Context Preservation**: Role definitions help new sessions understand the system

---

## The Agents

### 1. Chief Architect üë®‚Äçüíº

**Role**: System orchestrator & integration expert

**Scope**: Entire `threads-nextjs` repository

- Docker Compose orchestration
- Git submodule management
- CI/CD workflows
- System architecture
- Cross-service integration

**Files**:

- Context: `.claude/@chief-architect-context.md`
- Tasks: `@plan.md`
- Reports: Main `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` (to be created)

**Responsibilities**:

- Plan sprints and create tasks
- Coordinate with other agents
- Review integration points
- Manage infrastructure
- Make architectural decisions

---

### 2. ML Architect üß†

**Role**: ML infrastructure & algorithm expert

**Scope**: `ml-service/` submodule (threads-ml repo)

- ML algorithms and models
- Experiment tracking (MLflow)
- Model versioning & deployment
- Performance optimization
- Test coverage for ML components

**Files**:

- Context: `ml-service/@ml-architect-context.md`
- Tasks: `@plan.md` (assigned to ML Architect)
- Reports: `ml-service/SESSION_SUMMARY.md`

**Responsibilities**:

- Implement ML tasks from task board
- Maintain algorithm quality
- Track experiments with MLflow
- Optimize model performance
- Update ML service documentation

---

### 3. Future Agents (Template)

When adding new agents (Frontend Architect, DevOps, etc.):

1. Create context file: `.claude/@[role]-context.md`
2. Add role definition to `.claude/@chief-architect-context.md`
3. Create tasks in `@plan.md` for that role
4. Agent maintains their own `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` in their domain

---

## Communication Protocol

### Central Task Board: `@plan.md`

**Location**: `/threads-nextjs/@plan.md`
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all work
**Updated**: Every session by working agent

## How to Use (For Each Agent)

### Morning Standup (Start of Session)

1. **Read your context file**

   ```bash
   # For ML Architect
   cat ml-service/@ml-architect-context.md
   ```

2. **Check task board for assigned work**

   ```bash
   # Find tasks assigned to you in @plan.md
   grep -A 10 "ML Architect Tasks" @plan.md
   ```

3. **Review previous session summary**
   ```bash
   # Check what was accomplished last session
   cat ml-service/SESSION_SUMMARY.md | head -50
   ```

### During Session (Working on Task)

1. **Pick a task**
   - Update status: `pending` ‚Üí `in_progress`
   - Add date started

2. **Work on it**
   - Follow acceptance criteria
   - Write tests first (TDD)
   - Run tests locally: `uv run pytest`

3. **Quality checks**
   - Lint: `uv run ruff check --fix`
   - Format: `uv run ruff format`
   - Type hints: On all functions

4. **Commit with clear message**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(domain): description

   - Change 1
   - Change 2
   - Tests: 8/8 passing"
   ```

### End of Session (Handoff)

1. **Update task status** in `@plan.md`
   - Mark as `completed` ‚úÖ if done
   - Keep as `in_progress` if continuing
   - Document any blockers

2. **Update session summary** in your domain's `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`

   ```markdown
   ### Session [N] - [Date]

   **Completed**:

   - ‚úÖ Task: description

   **In Progress**:

   - üîÑ Task: description
   ```

3. **Push changes**

   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

4. **No uncommitted changes**
   - Verify: `git status` shows clean working directory
   - Save all work to commits

- [ ] No regressions
- [ ] Edge cases documented

**Related Files**:

- `ml-service/tests/unit/test_collaborative_filter.py`

```

### ML Architect Picks It Up

1. Reads task in `@plan.md`
2. Updates status: `pending` ‚Üí `in_progress`
3. Adds date: `Started: 2025-10-17`
4. Works on implementation

### ML Architect Reports Completion

# To: **Status**: in_progress
# Then: **Status**: completed ‚úÖ

nano @plan.md
# or use your preferred editor
```

### View System Architecture

## Success Metrics

### System Health

- ‚úÖ All agents have clear context files
- ‚úÖ Central task board active
- ‚úÖ Communication protocol established
- ‚úÖ Both repos synchronized

### Next Checkpoints

- [ ] ML Architect completes first assigned task
- [ ] Chief Architect creates integration task
- [ ] Session summaries kept up-to-date
- [ ] All tests passing in both repos

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know what to work on"

‚Üí Check `@plan.md` for tasks assigned to you with status `pending`

### "I finished my task, what now?"

‚Üí Update `@plan.md` status to `completed`, then check for next `pending` task assigned to you

### "Should I ask the other agent something?"

‚Üí Add note in `@plan.md` under their task or update `.claude/@chief-architect-context.md` under "Escalation" section

### "How do I report progress?"

‚Üí Update `@plan.md` status to `in_progress`, then write session notes in your domain's `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`

### "What if I need to commit in the submodule?"

```bash
# You're already in ml-service/ if working on ML tasks
cd ml-service
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master

# Then update main repo reference
cd ..
git add ml-service
git commit -m "chore: update ml-service submodule"
git push origin master
```
