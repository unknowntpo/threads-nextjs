## Known Issues

### 1. Forgot Password Page - 404 Not Found ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** `/auth/forgot-password` route returns 404 error

**Error URL:** `https://threads-nextjs.zeabur.app/auth/forgot-password?_rsc=1n57a`

**Root Cause:**

- Login form has link to `/auth/forgot-password` (components/login-form.tsx:72)
- Page route not implemented in `app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx`

**Solution Implemented:**

- ✅ Created `app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx` with password reset form
- ✅ Added `ForgotPasswordForm` component with email input
- ✅ Implemented `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` endpoint
- ✅ Security: No email enumeration (always returns success)
- ✅ Shows confirmation screen after submission

**TODO for Future:**

- [ ] Implement actual password reset token generation
- [ ] Add email sending functionality
- [ ] Create reset password confirmation page

**Status:** ✅ Fixed (basic UI/API implemented, email functionality pending)

### 2. Chrome Ad Blocker Warning

**Issue:** Chrome showing warning "This site tends to show ads that interrupt, distract, mislead, or prevent user control"

**Potential Causes:**

1. Next.js aggressive prefetching
2. OAuth redirect flow
3. Third-party scripts flagged by Chrome

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Disable prefetching for OAuth links: `<Link prefetch={false}>`
2. Check Chrome Search Console Abusive Experience Report
3. Review NextAuth redirect configuration

**Status:** ⏸️ Investigating (low priority)

---

## Current Status: MVP 7 Completed ✅

**What's Working:**

- ✅ Authentication (NextAuth with credentials, Google, GitHub)
- ✅ Post creation and display
- ✅ Social interactions (Like, Comment, Repost, Share)
- ✅ ML-powered personalized feed (collaborative filtering)
- ✅ Interaction tracking (view, click, like, share)
- ✅ Full CI/CD pipeline with tests
- ✅ Deployed on Zeabur

**Next Phase:** MVP 8 - Notification System 🔔

**Why Notifications Next:**

- Essential for user engagement and retention
- Users need to know when others interact with their content
- Foundation for building an active community
- Complements ML recommendations (users get notified about relevant interactions)

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Error Handling Improvements 🔧

**Goal:** Implement proper error handling with trace IDs for debugging without exposing sensitive information

**Current Issues:**

- Generic errors like "CredentialsSignin" don't provide enough context for debugging
- No trace/correlation IDs to track errors across logs
- Sensitive error details might be exposed to users

**Proposed Solution:**

**Backend (API Routes):**

- [ ] Create error handling utility with trace ID generation
- [ ] Log full error details server-side with trace ID
- [ ] Return sanitized errors to client with trace ID
- [ ] Example:
  ```typescript
  {
    "error": "Authentication failed",
    "trace_id": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
    "message": "Please check your credentials and try again"
  }
  ```

**Frontend:**

- [ ] Display user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Show trace ID in error UI for user to report
- [ ] Log errors to console with trace ID for debugging

**Technical Tasks:**

- [ ] Create `lib/errors.ts` with error handling utilities
- [ ] Add trace ID middleware for API routes
- [ ] Update all API error responses
- [ ] Update frontend error handling components
- [ ] Add error logging service (optional: Sentry integration)

**Effort Estimate:** ~8-12 hours

**Priority:** Medium - Improves debugging and user experience

**Status:** 📋 Planned
